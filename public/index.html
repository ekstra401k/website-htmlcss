          A multiple employer plan (MEP) is a qualified retirement plan maintained by two or
          more employers who are not related under control groups, trades, businesses under
          common control or affiliated service groups. A participating employer (PE) is any
          employer that participates in the MEP. As plans join the MEP, plan assets remain
          separate but, allow for greater buying power. The MEP still provides some
          flexibility and customization in design while providing greater efficiencies in the
          management and administration as a MEP.

          </h4>
          <p>
              Delegation doesn't change or limit your 401k liabilities and is commonly referred
              to as a co-fiduciary relationship. We are the named fiduciary so that liability
              and responsibility falls squarely on us &mdash; not you.

          <h4 id="ekstra-savings">
              <strong>Ekstra savings</strong> through economies of scale.
          </h4>
          <p>
              By design, the Ekstra 401(k) MEP is structured to help small and medium-sized
              plans achieve the same economies of scale as larger plans. The Ekstra difference
              is that those efficiencies mean more money stays in the participant's accounts.
              Over time, that will greatly improve participant retirement outcomes.

          <h4 id="ekstra-time">

          <p>
              The Ekstra 401(k) MEP eliminates most of the day-to-day burdens that come with a
              401(k) plan &mdash; leaving you with very little to do. You'll continue to submit
              contributions and provide employee data which typically can be automated. That
              means more time to focus on building your business.
