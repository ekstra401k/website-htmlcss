      A multiple employer plan (MEP) is a qualified retirement plan maintained
      by two or more employers who are not related under control groups, trades,
      businesses under common control or affiliated service groups. A
      participating employer (PE) is any employer that participates in the MEP.
      As plans join the MEP, plan assets remain separate but, allow for greater
      buying power. The MEP still provides some flexibility and customization in
      design while providing greater efficiencies in the management and
      administration as a MEP.
    </p>
    <blockquote id="key-selling-point">
      The Ekstra MEP provides greater <strong>fiduciary protection</strong> for
      you.<br />
      That makes your job that much easier but ultimately it
      <strong>benefits the plan participants</strong>
      the most.

        What are the advantages of The Participant First 401(k) by Ekstra?
      </blockquote>
      <h4>
        <strong>Ekstra protection</strong> &mdash; Tired of being told you're a
        fiduciary?
      </h4>
      <p>
        Delegation doesn't change or limit your 401k liabilities and is commonly
        referred to as a co-fiduciary relationship. We are the named fiduciary
        so that liability and responsibility falls squarely on us &mdash; not
        you.
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Ekstra savings</strong> through economies of scale.</h4>
      <p>
        By design, the Ekstra 401(k) MEP is structured to help small and
        medium-sized plans achieve the same economies of scale as larger plans.
        The Ekstra difference is that those efficiencies mean more money stays
        in the participant's accounts and over time greatly improves
        participant's retirement outcomes.
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Ekstra time</strong> to focus on your core business.</h4>
      <p>
        The Ekstra 401(k) MEP eliminates most of the day-to-day burdens of
        simply having a 401(k) plan &mdash; that leaves very little for you to
        do. You'll need to continue submitting contributions and providing the
        necessary employee data which should be able to be automated through
        your payroll process. That gives you more time and resources to focus on
        building your business. You'll still need to maintain a fidelity bond on
        the plan but you probably already have that taken care of.
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Ekstra expertise</strong> with a world class team!</h4>
      <p>
        Ekstra has put together a team of the best of the best to ensure your
        401k is world-class and operated at a fraction of the cost of what the
        typical plan is being charged.
      </p>
      <blockquote id="secondary-selling-point">
        The Participant First 401(k) by Ekstra is a
        <strong>transparent, secure and efficient</strong> solution that is
        <strong>more affordable</strong><br />than the typical 401(k) plan. That
        means participants simply<br /><strong>do better with us</strong>.
